# MSCompress

MScompress is a multi-threaded lossless and lossy compression tool for Mass Spectrometry data. We introduce a novel compressed file format (`.msz`) which enables random-access to the compressed file without a full decompression.

We include bindings for Python and NodeJS to utilize our `.msz` format and fast `.mzML` parser in your own applications. You can easily integrate MSCompress into your data processing workflows and take advantage of its efficient parsing and compression algorithms.
